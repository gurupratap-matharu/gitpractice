Today is August 10th, 2018 and I'm in Buenos Aires, Argentina staying at a hostel and working as a volunteer.
Today in my computer learning journey I learnt about the 'Emacs' text editor.

I did a basic first few steps of the tutorial and I seem to like it. The more textual, basic, lightweight and plain I become the more I like things.
I had learnt last month some basics about the vim editor and how to use it. Generally, on my Macbook when I wish to write some thoughts about myself, I generally use the vi, vim or the nano editor. All are basic and very fast. I really like to play with them. They make me feel very geeky and are real fast. Though I would say that I know only 30% of how to use them and still have a long way to go. 
But I should start. Do you use any of these editors.

Isn't command line a great way to talk to computers. It's improving me typing speed as well. I never knew I could be this better at it and now I only love it more and more.

I'll see you in my next letter.
